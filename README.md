# Dementia_Activity_Recognition_XML
This project addresses the challenges of using AI to recognise human activity in dementia care due to lack of trust in decisions done by AI. The models are able to recogise both normal and abnormal behaviors related to dementia. With the use of explainable machine learning algorithms, the decisions of this models were explained and interpreted.
